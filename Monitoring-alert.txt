Hereâ€™s the proposed method for notifying and alerting on undesirable behavior for your application:

1. Prometheus collects metrics on HTTP status codes, latency, and other application-specific behaviors.
2. Prometheus Alerting Rules are defined to trigger alerts when error rates are high, or latency exceeds thresholds.
3. Alertmanager sends notifications to the specified channels (email, Slack, etc.) based on the alerting rules.
4. Grafana can be used to visualize the application metrics and provide insights into the performance and health of the system.
  

This setup ensures that you are promptly notified when undesirable behaviors, such as high error rates or latency, occur in your application.
